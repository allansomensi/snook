# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First public version.

### Play
- Eight-ball with real ball physics, a computer opponent (three levels), two
  players on one computer, and games on the local network (host from the
  game; others find it automatically or join by address).
- Offline setup screens: names, the computer's level, the aiming guide and an
  optional shot clock.
- Replay of the last shot, a slim zoom bar, the top view as one icon, and
  right-dragging to turn the view.
- Text fields: arrow keys, Home/End, Delete, Ctrl+arrows, Ctrl+A, click to
  place the caret, keys repeat when held.

### Online
- Reactions during a match: 4 for everyone; the other 16 come from hard
  rated-game achievements (100 games, 50 wins, 10 in a row, rating 2100…)
  and from winning a rated game during an event (Halloween, the holidays,
  New Year). They pop up discreetly by the sender's card.
- Progress is earned slowly: smaller rating changes (K 24 for the first 10
  games, then 14, 8 from 1900), everyone starts as a Rookie, feats (8-ball
  wins, runouts, shutouts) count only in rated games, and at most 3 rated
  games a day against the same opponent. Games against the computer never
  touch ratings, numbers, achievements or reactions.
- The 8-ball pocket is called by clicking a pocket on the table (no panel),
  and the call is binding for the rest of the game.
- With the chat folded, new messages show a pulsing dot and a short preview.
- No full aiming guide against people: at most the standard one (the short
  line in rated games).
- The game points at the public server out of the box.
- Shots play instantly for both players (the shooter's is predicted locally;
  the server's result is authoritative).
- Fixed: a game won on the 8-ball was shown to the loser as a resignation.
- Accounts with a country flag; names coloured by rating tier; profiles with
  numbers, achievements (37, three of them events), the reactions unlocked
  and progress towards the next tier and match history; the world top 100.
- Open tables (public or private with a password), invitations, tournaments
  (4, 8 or 16 players, public or private), friends, blocking and reporting.
- The game's events appear in the match chat, quieter than what people write.
- The game signs in in the background; the menu shows who is signed in.

### Server
- PostgreSQL storage (Neon-ready) with migrations; in memory for LAN and tests.
- Hardened: hashed and renewed sessions, sign-in and sign-up throttling,
  flood and connection limits, bounded queues, simulation off the main lock,
  bans and mutes. See `docs/SECURITY.md`.
- Staff panel at `/admin` with an audit log. See `docs/ADMIN.md`.
- Docker image, Render blueprint, CI (PostgreSQL, image, dependency audit)
  and a release workflow.
